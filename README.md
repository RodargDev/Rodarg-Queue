# Minecraft-Server-Queue
This is a minecraft server queue like the one used in 2B2T and other anarchy servers. This plugin does also have priority queue and a way to skip the queue.

# How To
This plugin is only for **Bungeecord** servers.

The queue is seperated into 2 plugins. One plugin is for the bungeecord server and one is for the queue server.

Get the plugins here: {Spigot link}

# Feedback
This is my first opensource "project" so feedback is much appriciated.
