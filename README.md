# Rodarg - Minecraft Server Queue
This is a minecraft server queue like the one used in 2B2T and other anarchy servers. This plugin does also have priority queue and a way to skip the queue.

# How To
This plugin is only for **Bungeecord** servers.

The queue is seperated into 2 plugins. One plugin is for the bungeecord server and one is for the queue server.

Get the plugins here: {Spigot link}

Queue server setup:
1. Open the config file.
2. Change the "to-server" to the name in the bungeecord config of the server you want the people to be sent to.
3. Change the "player-limit" to the player limit of the server that players will get sent to.
4. Restart the server.

# Feedback
This is my first opensource "project" so feedback is much appriciated.
