# Rodarg - Minecraft Server Queue
This is a minecraft server queue like the one used in 2B2T and other anarchy servers. This plugin does also have priority queue and a way to skip the queue.

# How To
This plugin is only for **Bungeecord** servers.

The queue is seperated into 2 plugins. One plugin is for the bungeecord server and one is for the queue server.

Get the plugins here: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/minecraft-queue.85674/

*The spigot link also includes instructions on how to install it.*

# Refactoring
This plugin was created in 2020 and is a big mess, i am aware the code needs some cleanup

# Feedback
This is my first opensource "project" so feedback is much appriciated.
